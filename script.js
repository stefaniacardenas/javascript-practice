// This is where all the practise code from the Introduction to Javascript tutorial goes

console.log('Hello, this is my first line of JavaScript using Codebar');

// In JavaScript you always need to write var before the variable name
var name = "Codebar" ;
console.log(name + " is amazing!");

// JavaScript will always try to convert everything into a string.
// In the example below JavaScript will treat the number as a string and will concatenate it to the previous string.

var pi = 3.14;
console.log("The value of pi is " + pi);

var year = 2014
var nextYear = year + 1;
console.log("We are in " + year + " but " + nextYear + " is just around the corner!");
